In our study, we present more details on conferences,which have been on the IEEE conference list in 2017.This is just a hobby of mine.We will updata the conference constantly.Please put more attention on the sponsors. 1—–2017 IEEE 2nd Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference Conference: IAEAC2017 Data: 25-26, March, 2017 Venue: Chongqing Web site: www.iaeac.org Conference Number: # 39409 Conference Chair: Prof. Yi Zeng, Chongqing Global Union Academy of Science and Technology, China IEEE sponsors: IEEE Beijing Section Other sponsors: Chongqing Global Union Academy of Science and Technology (http://www.guast.org) The sponsors also hosted the conferences below: IEEE IMCEC(http://www.imcec.org), JIMET(http://www.jimet.org), JISEM(http://www.jisem.org), ICMITE(http://www.icmite.org), ITOEC, IEEE ITNEC(http://www.itnec.org).

It is also generally more sensitive and more robust compared with other popular classifiers. The process is defined as follows: Given a collection of training samples and a test sample in an n-dimensional feature space, find the nearest training samples from training set. It is a type of instance-based learning or lazy learning where requires the computation of distance of the test object to all the training objects in the training set. In the classification phase of KNN, the value of k and the distance metric are two fundamental model parameters. The value of k is often defined by users, and a test object is classified by assigning the class which is most frequent among the k training samples nearest to that test object. Euclidean distance is usually used as the distance metric.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"machine learning","slug":"machine-learning","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/machine-learning/"}]},{"title":"This is my first blog","slug":"hello-world","date":"2016-06-14T14:31:19.728Z","updated":"2016-06-16T07:04:01.896Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/06/14/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/06/14/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"welcome to zc-lab!
