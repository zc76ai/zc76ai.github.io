It is also generally more sensitive and more robust compared with other popular classifiers. The process is defined as follows: Given a collection of training samples and a test sample in an n-dimensional feature space, find the nearest training samples from training set. It is a type of instance-based learning or lazy learning where requires the computation of distance of the test object to all the training objects in the training set. In the classification phase of KNN, the value of k and the distance metric are two fundamental model parameters. The value of k is often defined by users, and a test object is classified by assigning the class which is most frequent among the k training samples nearest to that test object. Euclidean distance is usually used as the distance metric.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"machine learning","slug":"machine-learning","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/machine-learning/"}]},{"title":"This is my first blog","slug":"hello-world","date":"2016-06-14T14:31:19.728Z","updated":"2016-06-15T14:52:16.249Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/06/14/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/06/14/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"welcome to zc-lab!
